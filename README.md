ngram_missing_word_identification
=================================

Project used to help solve the 'Billion Word Imputation' competition on Kaggle.

http://www.kaggle.com/c/billion-word-imputation

The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that analyzing the Part of Speech
tags for n-grams can identify a missing word in a sentence. The ngrams are being 
constructed from the billion-word benchmark corpus from Cornell University.

My belief is that this process would be valuable in detecting gramatical errors in
an ill-formed sentence. I will also explore if this method would be valuable in finding
proper nouns and adjectives/adverbs.
