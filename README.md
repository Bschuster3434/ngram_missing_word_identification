ngram_missing_word_identification
=================================

Project used to help solve the 'Billion Word Imputation' competition on Kaggle

The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that analyzing the Part of Speech
tags for n-grams can identify a missing word in a sentence. The ngrams are being 
constructed from the billion-word benchmark corpus from Cornell University.
